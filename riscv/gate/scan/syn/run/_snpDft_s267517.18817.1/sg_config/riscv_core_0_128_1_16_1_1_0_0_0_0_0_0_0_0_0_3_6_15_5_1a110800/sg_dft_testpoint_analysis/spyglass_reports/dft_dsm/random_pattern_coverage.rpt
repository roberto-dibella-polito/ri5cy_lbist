 <>ABBREVIATIONS & DEFINITIONS OF TERMS : 

       1. hierarchical instance : an instance which has other hierarchical instances
                           and/or basic cells within it.

       2. !DT/ND fault :   A fault which was deemed testable but found to be undetectable.
                           (Note that faults classified as TI or BL are not included here.)
                           (Please see Info_coverage / Info_undetectCause violations).

       3. UT fault     :   A fault which cannot be detected because it has a non-X simulation
                           value. (Note that faults with nonX sim value in PG mode itself are
                           classified as TI faults.) 

       4. UU fault     :   An unused fault. Fault at a terminal becomes UU if that terminal
                           cannot be reached from the output ports. They are ignored because
                           they cannot affect system operation. By default, latches / 
                           blackboxes, whose outputs fanout to SyRd nodes only, and their 
                           fanin cone can be UU. If parameter dftUUMarking is on then 
                           flip-flops, whose outputs fanout to SyRd nodes only, and their fanin
                           cone can be UU. 

       5. SyRd fault   :   Faults at terminals which are Sy[= synthesis]Rd[= redundant].
                           These are terminals which are likely to be removed by an 
                           optimizing synthesizer, and hence should not be considered 
                           for fault/test coverage analysis. These are of the following types:
                           a) Pins which are tied high/low,
                           b) Pins blocked in power ground mode, and 
                           c) Unconnected combinational logic - all logic combinationally
                           connected to nodes that do not fanout to primary port. 
                           SyRd faults are reported iff fault analysis is done for an RTL design.
                           If design is a netlist, synthesis is already done and the question of
                           synthesis redundancy is considered invalid. 

       6. LR fault     :   These are logically redundant faults. Whatever be the state
                           of circuit, output on such nodes will always be a fixed 
                           value or are blocked by such fixed value nodes.

       7. PT fault     :   Faults in which difference between the good circuit 
                           result and bad circuit result for a particular fault 
                           produces any of the following are called Potential    
                           Detected Faults: 
                           Good Circuit Result  ---- Bad Circuit Result 
                                      0                z 
                                      0                x 
                                      1                z 
                                      1                x 

      8. TI/BL fault  :   This fault class comprises of faults which arise because of nets
                           being tied to 0 (Low) or 1(High), and the logic blocked by such nets.
                           If a net is tied to 0, S@0 is TIED. S@1 may or may not be detectable. 
                           Similarly, a net tied to 1 will make S@1 TIED. 
                           An input of a combinational gate tied to an appropriate value will 
                           make the faults in the fanin-cone of the other input as blocked. 
                           For example, an input of an AND gate tied to 0, will make faults in fanin-cone of the
                           other input BLOCKED. 

                           

    FORMULAE USED : 

                           Sum of fault detection probabilities + ((PT) * POSDETECT_credit)          
    Fault-Coverage % =  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  x 100 
                                      (2*terminalCount) - SyRd_faultCount                             
                           
                                   Sum of fault detection probabilities + ((PT) * POSDETECT_credit)   
    Test-Coverage %  =  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- x 100
                       (2*terminalCount) - SyRd_faultCount - TI - BL - UUCount - (ATPG_credit*UTCount) - LR


    Number of test patterns used for calculating fault detection probability : 1024 (specified through dft_pattern_count parameter)

 <>For top module the summary has been reported in three columns as follows:
    Column 1: Fault and Test coverage data due to top-level ports and internal design.
    Column 2: Fault and Test coverage data due to top-level ports only.
    Column 3: Fault and Test coverage data due to internal design only.

 <>For each module and hierarchical instance, ten numbers are reported. These are (in order)
    1. Count of terminals (IT) within the module (or instance) 
    2. Count of synth-redundant faults (SR) within the module (or instance)
    3. Count of faults considered (FC) within the module (or instance)      
    4. Count of unused (UU) faults within the module (or instance)
    5. Count of tied (TI) faults within the module (or instance)
    6. Count of blocked (BL) faults within the module (or instance)
    7. Count of logical redundant fault (LR) within this module (or instance)
    8. Count of un-testable (UT) faults within this module (or instance)
    9. Count of non-detectable (!DT) faults within this module (or instance)
   10. Count of potential detected (PT) faults within the module (or instance)

<> Alongside each module (and hierarchical instance) there is a search-key, of the form
             Module_[moduleIndex]  | Inst_[moduleIndex]_[instIndex]

  When opened in a text-editor, this key can be used to jump to the next (and only other)
  reference to the module (or instance) in the file. If an instance does NOT have a key
  then it means that this hierarchical instance has no hierarchical instances within it.
