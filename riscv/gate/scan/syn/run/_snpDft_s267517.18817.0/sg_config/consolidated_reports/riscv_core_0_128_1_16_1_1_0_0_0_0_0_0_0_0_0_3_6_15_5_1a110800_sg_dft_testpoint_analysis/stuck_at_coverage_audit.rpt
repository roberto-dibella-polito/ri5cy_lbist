# Purpose :
#    Section 1: Provides an audit report on maximizing
#               stuck_at fault coverage
#    Section 2: Provides an audit report to ensure that
#               ATPG tests operate as expected
################################################################################


################################################################################
# Format :
#    Section 1:
#    The first section of the report indicates the current coverage
#    for the design and the steps, in tabular format, that you need
#    to follow to improve the coverage. Each step has:
#        - The description of the root cause
#        - The improved fault and test coverage number, if the reported
#          issues for the step are fixed
#        - The diagnostic rules to debug the respective steps
#    
#    
#    Section 2:
#    The second section of the report covers rules that detect
#    conditions which, if not fixed, can prevent ATPG tests from
#    operating as expected.  As a result, actual coverage may be 
#    less than the result predicted by ATPG tools or tests may 
#    fail even when a chip is operating correctly.
#    
#    The rules in this section of the report are sorted by the
#    number of flip-flops affected by each rule

# Section 1:
#
 <>Reasons for Test Coverage to be less than 100 percent: 
       0. Current Coverage           : This step reports fault and test coverage of
                                       design in its current state. Please note that
                                       coverage number may be 100% even when there
                                       are Async_07 and / or Clock_11 violations.
                                       This is because violating flip-flops have 
                                       been declared forced scan using 'force_scan' sgdc
                                       command. Such flip-flops are detected using
                                       Info_forcedScan
       1. PIs and POs                : Set dft_treat_primary_inputs_as_x_source to 'off'
                                       to make primary inputs controllable
                                       Set dft_treat_primary_outputs_as_unobservable to 'off'
                                       to make primary outputs observable
       2. Non-Scannable Flops        : Non-scannable flip-flops reduce circuit controllability
                                       and observability for combinational ATPG.
                                       Detected using Async_07 and Clock_11
                                       rules in dft/dft_scan_ready goal
       3. Non-Scan-wrapped black box : I/P terminals of non-scan-wrapped BB's are 
                                       unobservable and o/p terminals are uncontrollable.
                                       Detected using any DFT rule Info_scanwrap or 
                                       dft/dft_scan_ready goal
       4. Non-Transparent and        : Non-transparent / Non-scannable latches require
          Non-Scannable Latches        sequential ATPG. Detected using Latch_08 and Latch_19
                                       rules in dft/dft_best_practice goal
       5. Combinational Loops        : Combinational loops may not be controllable.
                                       This may reduce test coverage of the circuit.
                                       Such Loops are detected by Topology_01.
                                       Additionally, loops with non-X value may also 
                                       reduce coverage
       6. Testmode values in Capture : Testmode values in capture mode restrict ATPG.
                                       This step includes the undetectable faults due to
                                       pins tied high or low.
                                       Detected using Info_untestable and Info_pwrGndSim
       7. Hanging Nets               : Undriven nets and pins are uncontrollable.
                                       Detected using DFT/dft_test_points goal (TA_09 rule)
       8. Tristates                  : Enable pins of tristate devices are unobservable. 
                                       Detected using DFT/dft_test_points goal (TA_09 rule).
       9. 'force_ta' and 'test_point': Pins and nets having 'force_ta' or 'test_point' constraint
          constraint pins/nets         will have their testability governed by constraint.
                                       These will hinder test coverage
       10. 'no_scan' Flip-flops       : Flops which are forced no_scan by user or inferred no_scan
                                       will not generate Async_07 or Clock_11 violations, 
                                       but will hinder coverage

   For each top module 2 numbers are reported against the step taken. These are (in order):
    a)  Fault Coverage in percentage 
    b)  Test Coverage in percentage
